# Development Log

## 11/22
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on beginning to parse the dataset, and creating necessary data structures to store data.

### Progress
During this week, due to conflicting schedules over break, we were unable to make any substanial progress on this week's goals.

## 11/29
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on catching up on the previous week's objectives, as well as completing one traversal algorithm (BFS) and one graph algorithm.

### Progress
During this week, our group was able to build necessary data structures (node struct and graph class) to store our data, parse our data set and store this in our data structures, and implement the BFS traversal algorithm.

## 12/6 
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on completing the shortest path algorithm and visualization implementation, writing sufficient test cases to test our code, and outlining the written report and presentation.

### Progress

During this week, our group was able to complete the graph visualization algorithm. This algorithm works as intended, and it presents an image of the graph of road networks in San Francisco. We are currently still working on implementing test cases and completing our shortest path algorithm so that it works as intended on our large dataset.


## 12/13
### Progress

Based on last week's goals, we have finished everything we planned on doing. We finished working implementations of shortest path, as well as the graph visualization algorithm. We have additionally completed testing and commenting our code.
