### **CS 225 Data Structures**
<br />
** Team Contract (surajr4-lakshay3-cbhatia3-chiragm3) **
<br />
<br />
**Communication**
<br />
**Team Meetings**: Our team will ideally meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00pm-7:00pm in person, but our meeting times can be more flexible and spontaneous throughout the week. One person will take notes on Google Docs shared with the others and this position will be rotated throughout the project. This assigned note take will also update the team on development progress. 
<br />
**Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted over in person, text, discord, or email. We commit to responding to emails within 24 hours. 
<br />
**Respect:** All decisions will be made with majority, with hopeful unanimous approval. Other arguments will be handled through conversation and compromise.
<br />
<br />
**Collaboration**
<br />
**Work Distribution:** The team will determine weekly goals for the project based on project vision and previous weekly progress. These weekly goals will then be split even further to assign tasks to teams of one to two people so more work can be done over the week. Open communication will also be done in order to ensure that one person is not doing too much comparatively. 
<br />
**Time Commitment:** We hope to ensure everyone is working equally time-wise and effort-wise. Firstly, each member is expected to be fully present and contributing during team meetings. Secondly, everyone is expected to work two to six hours per week on the project. If any problems arise or one member has to work extra on a certain part of the project, others will reach out to help them. It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure each milestone of the project is completed. If a team member is noticed to not be completing their work on time, we will all have a conversation about what they need to succeed and how we can help them get their work done on time. 
<br />
**Conflict Resolution:** Any conflicts within the team will be resolved by playing the online game ‘Get on Top’. The winner of this game will decide the course of action
